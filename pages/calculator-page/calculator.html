      <p class="section-body">
        Although I probably wasn't the first person in the world to create a calculator, 
        the main thing that sets mine apart is my refusal to use any libraries, with the exception of "pygame", of course, which was needed to create visual displays. 
        The Python "math" library is specifically designed for difficult calculations, but I wanted to find a workaround method, which doesn't rely on the existence of "math". 
        This, of course, led to some interesting challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        On various occasions during my creation process, I was asked a question along the lines of "Why are you making this?", or "Why on Earth would you subject yourself to this?".
        Every time, I would provide the same answer: "To prove that I can". I'd like to think that I ultimately succeeded, despite some obvious limitations. For example, there have been
        a lot of complaints about the calculator's lack of trigonometric capability (Just kidding, nobody actually asked for trig, but I'm still working on it because sine waves look cool on graphs).

      <p class="section-title">Next Steps</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Even though senior defense is done, I still want to keep working on this calculator. 
        I think there's still a lot left to complete, and more importantly, I'm in too deep at this point to stop now. 
        <br />
        <br />
        As mentioned before, I need to add trigonometric functions. I plan to add all 12 functions. 
        I've already started working on the main 3 functions (sin, cos, tan), and will then work on the 3 reciprocal ones (csc, sec, cot). 
        When I'm done those, I'll work on the 6 inverse ones (arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccsc, arcsec, arccot), although these might be the most challenging. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I also want to add logarithmic and exponential functions. The problem with exponentials before was that they generated numbers too large for my computer, and would basically break the whole program, 
        but I could try to find a way to minimize the power it requires. 
        <br />

        Stay tuned for updates!
