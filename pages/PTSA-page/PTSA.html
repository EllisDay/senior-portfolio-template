      <p class="section-title">Finding a Client</p>

      <p class="section-body">
        In my sophomore year of APP Academy, one of our projects was, in groups, to create a website design for a real client. 
        With teammates Zach Huang and Euntaek Kim, I revised aspects of the original PTSA website that seemed slightly less fresh, to say the least. 
        In their defense, the PTSA website was probably created a long time ago. Maybe it was one of the first websites ever created.

      <p class="section-title">Managing Workflow</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        We thought of some aspects of the original website that could be improved upon, and each started working on our own pages, using Trello to manage tasks. 
        I worked on the home page, Zach worked on a new event calendar, and Euntaek worked on a school store, with sample items like Prom tickets and merch. 
      </p>

      <p class="section-body">
        We made it decently far, and came out with a design that we were happy with, using Figma.
