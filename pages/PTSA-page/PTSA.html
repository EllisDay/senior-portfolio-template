      <p class="section-title">What's so Special About it?</p>

      <p class="section-body">
        Although I probably wasn't the first person in the world to create a calculator, 
        the main thing that sets mine apart is my refusal to use any libraries, with the exception of "pygame", of course, which was needed to create visual displays. 
        The Python "math" library is specifically designed for difficult calculations, but I wanted to find a workaround method, which doesn't rely on the existence of "math". 
        This, of course, led to some interesting challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        On various occasions during my creation process, I was asked a question along the lines of "Why are you making this?", or "Why on Earth would you subject yourself to this?".
        Every time, I would provide the same answer: "To prove that I can". I'd like to think that I ultimately succeeded, despite some obvious limitations. For example, there have been
        a lot of complaints about the calculator's lack of trigonometric capability (Just kidding, nobody actually asked for trig, but I'm still working on it because sine waves look cool on graphs).

            On this project, I worked with the head of the layout department and
            the head of the outreach and social media department. Our layout
            head acted as the UX designer, producing mood boards, color schemes,
            and an inital prototype. Our outreach head acted as the UX
            researcher, pushing out surveys and getting feedback through our
            social media platforms.

            I acted as a project manager and developer, keeping track of the
            overarching deadline, approving designs, leading team meetings,
            assigning tasks, and developing a large part of the actual website.

            The grant required us to build a website that described the purpose
            of the project, the team, events, and project deliverables. We also
            needed a way for users to subscribe to the newsletter, find team
            meeting times and locations, and read current and past newsletters.

      <p class="section-body">
        Our layout designer worked on an initial prototype in Figma - working to
        design something that would meet three primary needs: sharing current
        and past newsletters, displaying information about the club, and
        allowing users to subscribe.
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        After going through a couple rounds, she presented this initial design
        to the rest of the team. There was a lot of positive feedback, as well
        as some good constructive points.

            A lot of the team liked the simplicity of the navigation menu and
            information architecure, noting it was really easy to find
            everything and navigate through the website. <br /><br />
            Team members also liked the use of a grid layout for past
            newsletters and how simple the subscribe feature was.
            <br /><br />
            But in terms of the color & typography choices, the team was
            divided.

            The designer explained she was trying to resemble the colors and
            style of a vintage newspaper. But other members argued that the
            colors should be more aligned with the newsletter brand colors -
            purples, blues, and greens. In a survey that our head of outreach
            posted on Instagram, the majority agreed to make the switch to a
            cooler color palette.

      <p class="section-title">The Final Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        For the final design, we kept some of the features from the initial
        design - such as the navigation bar, most of the navigation labels, and
        the simple subscription form. We also kept the grid layout to display
        past newsletters. <br />
        <br />
        We did change the color scheme to a combination of purples and blues,
        which better matched our other brand and social media materials. We
        added an additional page for events and moved the subscription form to
        the home page.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form posts the
        submitted emails to a google sheets, using a custom API built using the
        platform SheetDb. The website is deployed through Vercel.

      <p class="section-body">
        Even though senior defense is done, I still want to keep working on this calculator. 
        I think there's still a lot left to complete, and more importantly, I'm in too deep at this point to stop now. 
        <br />
        <br />
        As mentioned before, I need to add trigonometric functions. I plan to add all 12 functions. 
        I've already started working on the main 3 functions (sin, cos, tan), and will then work on the 3 reciprocal ones (csc, sec, cot). 
        When I'm done those, I'll work on the 6 inverse ones (arcsin, arccos, arctan, arccsc, arcsec, arccot), although these might be the most challenging. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I also want to add logarithmic and exponential functions. The problem with exponentials before was that they generated numbers too large for my computer, and would basically break the whole program, 
        but I could try to find a way to minimize the power it requires. 
        <br />

        Stay tuned for updates!
